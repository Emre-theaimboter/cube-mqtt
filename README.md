## Usage

The app is designed with three main pages to provide a seamless MQTT experience:

- **Main Page (MQTT Client)**  
Enter your MQTT broker details (e.g., host, port, username, password) to establish a connection. Once connected, subscribe to topics to receive messages or publish messages to specific topics of your choice.

- **Log Page**  
Monitor all events in real-time, including successful connections, disconnections, sent and received messages, and any errors. This detailed log helps you manage and troubleshoot your MQTT interactions effectively.

- **Settings Page**  
Customize your experience by enabling or disabling notifications, checking for app updates, resetting the log history, or sharing the app with others via a share link.

### Example

To test the app with a public MQTT broker, use the following details:

- **Host**: `test.mosquitto.org`
- **Port**: `8080`
- **Topic**: `test/topic`

Enter these details in the Main Page, connect to the broker, subscribe to the topic, and publish a test message to see the app in action. Check the Log Page to verify the events.
